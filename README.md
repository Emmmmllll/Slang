*This the language is inspired by the Rust Programming language as well as its compiler structure*

**Goals:**
- [ ] System programming language by default
- [ ] Able to be a scripting languge/plugin language
- [ ] has advantages of rust-lang e.g. traits over inheritance, powerful enums, macros, lifetimes
- [ ] can be used to generate other languages
- [ ] Fun journey
